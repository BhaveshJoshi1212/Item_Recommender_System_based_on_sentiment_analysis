# Item_Recommender_System_based_on_sentiment_analysis


## Project Overview
Developed an advanced recommendation system integrating **collaborative filtering** and **sentiment analysis** to deliver personalized product suggestions based on user reviews. This system combines multiple machine learning and NLP techniques to enhance recommendation accuracy and relevance.

## Key Techniques and Processes

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - **Data Gathering:** Acquired user reviews, product ratings, and user information.
   - **Text Preprocessing:** Utilized **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text cleaning, including tokenization, stop word removal, and part-of-speech tagging to prepare the data for analysis.
   - **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Employed **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** vectorizer to transform text data into numerical features, capturing the significance of words within documents.
2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - **Class Imbalance Handling:** Addressed class imbalance in sentiment labels using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to create a balanced dataset for model training.
   - **Feature Engineering:** Applied TF-IDF to convert text reviews into feature vectors suitable for machine learning models.

3. **Model Building:**
   - **Classification Algorithms:** Implemented and compared various **machine learning algorithms** including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost for sentiment classification.
   - **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluated models using **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1 Score**, and **ROC-AUC**. Used **confusion matrix** and **ROC curve** for performance assessment.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized Random Forest parameters using **Grid Search** to enhance model performance.

4. **Collaborative Filtering Approaches:**
   - **User-User Collaborative Filtering:** Developed a User-User recommendation model based on user similarity using **cosine similarity** to compute user-user distances and predict ratings.
   - **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering:** Built an Item-Item recommendation model focusing on item similarity, calculating item-item distances to recommend products not yet rated by users.

5. **Sentiment-Based Recommendation Integration:**
   - **Sentiment Prediction:** Integrated **sentiment analysis** using an XGBoost model to classify review sentiments (positive or negative).
   - **Recommendation Enhancement:** Refined product recommendations by combining collaborative filtering results with sentiment analysis, prioritizing products with higher positive sentiment scores.

6. **Evaluation and Comparison:**
   - **Model Comparison:** Compared performance of different recommendation models using **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** to identify the most effective model.
   - **Recommendation System Integration:** Enhanced recommendations by integrating sentiment analysis results with collaborative filtering to improve relevance and accuracy.



## Key Achievements
- Successfully combined **collaborative filtering** and **sentiment analysis** to improve recommendation quality.
- Demonstrated practical application of **NLP** techniques and **machine learning** algorithms in a real-world recommendation system.
- Enhanced recommendation relevance through integration of sentiment analysis, providing more personalized product suggestions.
